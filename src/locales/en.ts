        title: '1985 · Liangying Town, Shantou. At dawn, mist rose from the Lian River.',
        paragraphs: `Cheng polished his sewing machine and set it in the family courtyard, running newly purchased knitted fabric across his fingertips.
"Fabric worn on the body," he said, "should never be compromised."
His wife, expecting their first child, worked the pedal - its steady rhythm like a heartbeat. His father carried boxes of finished sportswear toward the village entrance, handwritten: Handle with care. His mother cooked rice noodles for everyone. Rice steam mixed with fabric dust in the air. That everyday warmth - shared, human, unadorned became the earliest culture of what would later be FONGCING Textile.`,

        paragraphs: `In the early 1990s, orders grew rapidly.Cheng came to a clear realization: no matter how refinedthe cut or workmanship, unstable fabric weakens agarment from the very beginning.
In 1992, he chose to move upstream-from finishedgarments to fabric, and from fabric to yarn.The family relocated into a dyeing facility, making adecisive commitment at the boiling vats: to build from thesource.
By 1995, the first generation of FONGCING Textile wasestablished, with its own knitting workshop.From yarn onward, Cheng began studying fabricstructure, stability, and character.
In 2000, FONGCING moved beyond simply "making goodfabric," launching a comprehensive R8D program focusedon durability, comfort, breathability, and resiliencemarking its transition from a fabric manufacturer to atrue development partner`,

The space was modest and orderly, with fabricscategorized by fiber, weight, and application-eachaccompanied by test data and technical notes.Cheng personally welcomed buyers, designers, andpartners from China and abroad.
For FONGClNG,"premium" was never about surfaceappearonce.
It meant comfort and reassurance proven through timeand wear.
Here, the company began building long-termrelationships as a fabric partner, rather than a simplesupplier.`,

Yet the family has never focused on how far they havecome-
only on how the next meter of fabric can be made better.They continue seeking balance between softness anddurability,
